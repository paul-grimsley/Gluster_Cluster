# Gluster_Cluster
This was coauthored by myself and a Red Hat Gluster instructor. It was written for the KVM environment to be able to rapidly stand up a training lab for the class. You will need to make sure you enable virtualization in your KVM environment. I have included a document to help with that in case you are unfamiliar with KVM.
Some of the files were too big (created place holders for them) so i had to stage them in my google drive if you are interested let me know and i will give you access to that folder to pull them down.
