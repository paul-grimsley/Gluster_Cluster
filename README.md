# Gluster_Cluster
This was coauthored by myself and a Red Hat Gluster instructor. It was written for the KVM environment to be able to rapidly stand up a training lab for the class. You will need to make sure you enable virtualization in your KVM environment. I have included a document to help with that in case you are unfamiliar with KVM.
